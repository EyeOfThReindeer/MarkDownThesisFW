# MarkDownThesisFW
This framework is a tool that utilizes [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to create beautiful standalone ebooks and documents from multiple [MarkDown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) markup files. The text contents are written in plain text, and can therefore be tracked by version control system, like Git, and before exporting to pdf or epub, the MD code is translated to, and interpreted as [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org).

> Note: The project is still in progress of creation, was abandoned for a while, and currently in some alpha development stage. This note will be removed, once the project is ready to be published properly

See `docs/content/chapters` folder for example and more info:

* Intro: A story behind the project, and overwiew of its features
* News: A diary I write as I go on with the project
* Docs: A technical notes on how to use the framework
* Examples: Example chapter showing what is simple MD capable of
