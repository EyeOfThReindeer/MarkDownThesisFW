# MarkDownThesisFW
This framework is a tool that utilizes [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to create beautiful standalone ebooks and documents from multiple [MarkDown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) markup files. The text contents are written in plain text, and can therefore be tracked by version control system, like Git, and before exporting to pdf or epub, the MD code is translated to, and interpreted as [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org).

> Note: The project is just several days old, and currently in some pre-alpha development stage. This note will be removed, once the project is ready to be published properly
